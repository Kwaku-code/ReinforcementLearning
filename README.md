This project reviews Temporal Difference for the control problem and studies two special cases of temporal difference namely SARSA and Expected SARSA. We consider a card game scenario where we make considerations for using either case to find the best policy. The study concludes that if we are interested in a stationary or stable policy, then Expected SARSA almost certainly is best but if we care about randomness of the process then SARSA is used for finding the best policy
